[2024-12-03 13:08:26] [javac-output-93115]   not setting the location of system modules may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 17
[2024-12-03 13:08:26] [javac-output-93115]     --release 17 is recommended instead of -source 17 -target 17 because it sets the location of system modules automatically
