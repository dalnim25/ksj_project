[2024-12-03 15:20:05] [javac-output-12156] warning: [options] location of system modules is not set in conjunction with -source 17
[2024-12-03 15:20:05] [javac-output-12156]   not setting the location of system modules may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 17
[2024-12-03 15:20:05] [javac-output-12156]     --release 17 is recommended instead of -source 17 -target 17 because it sets the location of system modules automatically
