[2024-12-03 16:27:29] [javac-output-17472]   not setting the location of system modules may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 17
[2024-12-03 16:27:29] [javac-output-17472]     --release 17 is recommended instead of -source 17 -target 17 because it sets the location of system modules automatically
