[2024-12-04 16:36:33] [javac-output-58021]   not setting the location of system modules may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 17
[2024-12-04 16:36:33] [javac-output-58021]     --release 17 is recommended instead of -source 17 -target 17 because it sets the location of system modules automatically
